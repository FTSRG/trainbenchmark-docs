\section{Summary of Contributions}


\subsection{Scientific Contributions}

We achieved the following scientific contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We proposed a concept to investigate the relationships between graph-based metrics and performance of query evaluations.
	\item We provided an approach of uniform graph generation among different topologies.
	\item We proposed a solution to estimate the number of edges in the hierarchical network topology.
\end{itemize}
