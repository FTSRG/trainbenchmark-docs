\chapter{Summary}

\section{Scientific Contributions}

We achieved the following scientific contributions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We proposed a concept to investigate the relationships between graph-based metrics and performance of query evaluations.
	\item We provided an approach of uniform graph generation among different topologies.
	\item We proposed a solution to estimate the number of edges in the hierarchical network topology.
\end{itemize}

\section{Practical Accomplishments}

We achieved the following practical accomplishments:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We designed a framework for metric-based performance analysis.
	\item We elaborated a benchmark framework to assess the performance of query evaluations on homogeneous graph topologies.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

The following tasks are addressed as future works:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Along the query and model metrics, we would like to investigate the effect of \emph{query on model metrics}~\cite{metric_ase}. The query on model metrics could be used to characterize specific cardinalities of the model (\eg the number of vertex types, the number of hubs, etc.)
	\item The evaluation in this report focused on \emph{semantic databases}. In the future, we also plan to evaluate the performance of \emph{graph databases}, \eg Neo4j~\cite{Neo4j} and OrientDB~\cite{OrientDB}.
	\item To achieve better prediction, we would like to experiment with non-linear regression models. 
\end{itemize}
