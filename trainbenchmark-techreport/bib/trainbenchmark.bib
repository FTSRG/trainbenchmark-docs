	In graph transformation, the most cost-intensive phase of a transformation execution is pattern matching, where those subgraphs of a model graph are identified and matched which satisfy constraints prescribed by graph patterns. Incremental pattern matching aims to improve the efficiency of this critical step by storing the set of matches of a graph transformation rule and incrementally maintaining it as the model changes, thus eliminating the need of recalculating existing matches of a pattern. In this paper, we propose examples where incremental pattern matching is expected to have advantageous effect in the application domain of model simulation and model synchronization. Moreover, we compare the incremental graph pattern matching approach of Viatra2 with advanced non-incremental local-search based graph pattern matching approaches (as available in Viatra2 and GrGen).</p>

	Queries are the foundations of data intensive applications. In model-driven software engineering (MDSE), model queries are core technologies of tools and transformations. As software models are rapidly increasing in size and complexity, most MDSE tools frequently exhibit scalability issues that decrease developer productivity and increase costs. As a result, choosing the right model representation and query evaluation approach is a significant challenge for tool engineers. In the current paper, we aim to provide a benchmarking framework for the systematic investigation of query evaluation performance. More specifically, we experimentally evaluate (existing and novel) query and instance model metrics to highlight which provide sufficient performance estimates for different MDSE scenarios in various model query tools. For that purpose, we also present a comparative benchmark, which is designed to differentiate model representation and graph query evaluation approaches according to their performance when using large models and complex queries.</p>
