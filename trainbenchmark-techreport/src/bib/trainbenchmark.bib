	In graph transformation, the most cost-intensive phase of a transformation execution is pattern matching, where those subgraphs of a model graph are identified and matched which satisfy constraints prescribed by graph patterns. Incremental pattern matching aims to improve the efficiency of this critical step by storing the set of matches of a graph transformation rule and incrementally maintaining it as the model changes, thus eliminating the need of recalculating existing matches of a pattern. In this paper, we propose examples where incremental pattern matching is expected to have advantageous effect in the application domain of model simulation and model synchronization. Moreover, we compare the incremental graph pattern matching approach of Viatra2 with advanced non-incremental local-search based graph pattern matching approaches (as available in Viatra2 and GrGen).</p>

	Queries are the foundations of data intensive applications. In model-driven software engineering (MDSE), model queries are core technologies of tools and transformations. As software models are rapidly increasing in size and complexity, most MDSE tools frequently exhibit scalability issues that decrease developer productivity and increase costs. As a result, choosing the right model representation and query evaluation approach is a significant challenge for tool engineers. In the current paper, we aim to provide a benchmarking framework for the systematic investigation of query evaluation performance. More specifically, we experimentally evaluate (existing and novel) query and instance model metrics to highlight which provide sufficient performance estimates for different MDSE scenarios in various model query tools. For that purpose, we also present a comparative benchmark, which is designed to differentiate model representation and graph query evaluation approaches according to their performance when using large models and complex queries.</p>

This paper summarizes an approach to synthesizing decision trees that has been used in a variety of systems, and it describes one such system, ID3, in detail. Results from recent studies show ways in which the methodology can be modified to deal with information that is noisy and/or incomplete. A reported shortcoming of the basic algorithm is discussed and two means of overcoming it are compared. The paper concludes with illustrations of current research directions.}},

First, model-sensitive search plan generation is proposed for pattern traversal (as an extension to traditional multiplicity and type considerations of existing tools) by estimating the expected performance of search plans on typical instance models that are available at transformation design time. Then, an adaptive approach for graph pattern matching is presented, where the optimal search plan can be selected from previously generated search plans at run-time based on statistical data collected from the current instance model under transformation.},

        abstract = {This paper proposes a different type of Genetic Network Programming ({GNP)} Variable Size Genetic Network Programming ({GNPvs)} with Binomial Distribution. In contrast to the individuals with fixed size in Standard {GNP}, {GNPvs} will change the size of the individuals and obtain the optimal size of them during evolution. The proposed method defines a new type of crossover to implement the new feature of {GNP.} The new crossover will select the number of nodes to move from each parent {GNP} to another parent {GNP.} The probability of selecting the number of nodes to move satisfies the binomial probability distribution. The proposed method can keep the effectiveness of crossover and improve the performance of {GNP.} In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, a well-known benchmark problem Tile-world is used in the simulations. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},
