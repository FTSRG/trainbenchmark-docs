\subsection{Batch Query Evaluation}

TODO

% all characteristics are polynomial, slopes are similar: mostly constant factor differences
% dominated by model de-serialization for simpler queries
% 
% three groups of tools (within 3-4 orders of magnitude)
% slow: MySQL, Neo4j, Neo4jRAM, Drools
% medium: Sesame, Java
% fast: OCL, IncQuery

% In case of batch query evaluation, both OCL implementations use the same
% algorithm, thus their execution time is roughly the same. The roughly negligible
% differences are due to the initialization of the OCL Impact Analyzer.
% 
% For the \emph{batch query} evaluation of the \textsf{RouteSensor} query
% \autoref{fig:BatchValid_RouteSensor} shows that \eiq{} performs similarly
% to Eclipse OCL. It is slightly faster for small models (2 s and 3 s
% respectively), but is slower for large models (up to 125 s and 78 s), where
% this 50\% slowdown (once in the whole scenario) can be attributed to the
% initial (Rete) cache build.

% Both OCL measurements use Eclipse OCL for the batch phase,
% because the Impact Analyser is not built for this purpose according to the
% authors. However, the initialisation of the OCL Impact Analyser also occurs in
% this phase resulting in (roughly negligible) higher execution time.

% For the more complex \textsf{SignalNeighbor} query
% \autoref{fig:BatchValid_SignalNeighbor} depicts that \eiq{} (somewhat
% surprisingly) outperforms OCL solutions: it is noticeably faster for small
% modells (2 s and 4 s), and over 435k model elements OCL did not finish with
% the initial analysis in 12 minutes. This performance gain might be attributed to
% the more efficient (cached) enumeration of instances, and the possibility of
% backward navigation (with the help of auxiliary structures) on unidirectional
% references used by this query.

\subsection{Incremental Query Evaluation}
TODO

% characteristic difference between search-based and incremental tools
% 
% fast: IncQuery, Drools. IncQuery much faster for complex queries

% In the \emph{incremental case}, Eclipse OCL evaluates the query on each run
% (100 times) from scratch, its execution time increases linearly with
% model size, resulting slow overall evaluation.
 
% For the \textsf{RouteSensor} query (\autoref{fig:SumInc_RouteSensor}), the Impact
% Analyzer performs the 100 modifications in 350 ms regardless of the model
% size. On the same query, \eiq{} starts much faster, but its speed reduces
% on the larger models (from 9 to 220 ms). On the other hand, the Impact
% Analyzer is an order of magnitude slower on the \textsf{SignalNeighbor} query
% (\autoref{fig:SumInc_SignalNeighbor}) query: it does not finish in 12 minutes
% for models over 61k model elements, while \eiq{} handles every model
% regardless of size under 40 ms.
 
% The performance of the Impact Analyzer is most likely affected by the previously
% mentioned unidirectional references. The slowdown of \eiq{} is probably
% caused by the increased number of matches (from 116 to 8592), as query
% results are always available in the output nodes of Rete networks, and only a
% linear traversal of these stored matches is needed to return them.

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

\subsubsection{Internal threats}

\paragraph{Mitigating measurement risks}
We tried to mitigate \emph{internal validity} threats by reducing the number of
uncontrolled variables during measurements: a physical machine was used with all
unnecessary software components turned off and every execution was isolated into
a freshly initialized JVM.

\paragraph{Ensuring functional equivalence and correctness}
The queries are semantically equivalent in the different query languages and the
result sets are the same for every model. 

Our current measurements only loaded and executed a single query in each run.
When loading multiple queries, query interference may change the results
greatly. A more detailed evaluation of this issue is planned for the future.


\paragraph{Memory measurements}
It is important to note that heap usage were measured after executing a garbage
collection, so these measurements do not contain memory usage of temporary
constructs. This means that maximum heap usage might have been larger. Furthermore,
limiting heap space by the maximum usage results in excessive garbage collection
and thus an increased runtime. However, in our experience setting the limit to
two times the measured values, such issues do not occur.



\paragraph{Code reviews}
Additionally, to ensure comparable
results the created high-quality query implementations were reviewed: the OCL
implementation by Ed Willink from the Eclipse OCL project, the usage of Impact
Analyzer by Axel Uhl from the Impact Analyzer developer team. The graph patterns
were written by the developers of \eiq{}. SPARQL code was reviewed by a semantic web expert. Drools rules were reviewed by the JBoss Drools developer team. 

\subsubsection{External threats}

\paragraph{Metrics and generalizability of results}
Considering \emph{external validity}, the generalization of the results largely
depends on how representative the metamodels, the models and the queries are
compared to real use cases. In section \ref{specification-extended} metrics were
defined to describe complexity of models and queries, however comparing them to
real world ones remains a future work.

\paragraph{Industrial relevance}
The metamodel and the query specifications were motivated by an industrial case
study, and the selected queries feature commonly used validation tasks such as
attribute and reference checks or cycle detection. We tried to ensure that the
instance models have a similar structure and distribution to other models by
parameterizing the generation process based on our experience with other
domains. To summarize, we believe that the train domain and the generated
instance models represent other domain-specific languages and available instance
models well.

\paragraph{Resource usage}
Considering resource-constrained environments, we believe that limiting
available memory will alter the results the most, as the memory management
overhead will reduce the performance of \eiq{}.

In case of the benchmark queries, we measured a $1.5$GB heap size in case of a
model with $3.5$M model elements that we believe is manageable in a developer
machine with $4$--$8$GB of RAM. On the other hand, when handling such large
models the existing user interface itself could become a bottleneck. Thus we
believe, our measurement results hold also in the integrated development
environments.
