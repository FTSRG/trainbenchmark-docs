In this tech report, we presented the \emph{Train Benchmark}, an extensible framework for the definition and execution of  benchmark scenarios for modeling tools. The framework supports the construction of benchmark test sets that specify the 
metamodel, instance model generation, queries and transformations, result collection and processing, and metric evaluation logic that are intended to provide an end-to-end solution. Additionally, we also presented a concrete test case set corresponding to the the original Train Benchmark implementation of \cite{SCP2014} and its metric-focused extensions in \cite{ASE2013}.

In addition to the results presented in previous academic papers, the tech report contains a comprehensive set of measurement results comparing 7 different tools from three technological domains (Ecore, RDF/SPARQL, property graphs). These results allow for intra-domain and inter-domain tool comparison and detailed execution time characteristics analysis.

As future work, we plan to incorporate further tools (such as Egyed's OCL Impact Analyzer, Epsilon, ATL, other NoSQL databases using the Tinkerpop API and the Gremlin language). Additionally, work has begun to create a new benchmark case based on source code modernization base study in MONDO.
